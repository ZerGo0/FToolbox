# Current Task: Creators Feature Implementation

## Task Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Creators feature for FToolbox to track and analyze Fansly creator statistics, similar to the existing Tags feature.

## Completed Work

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Database Models
- Created `Creator` model (`backend-go/models/creator.go`):
  - Stores creator data: ID, username, display name, media likes, post likes, followers, image/video counts
  - Includes deletion tracking and timestamps
  
- Created `CreatorHistory` model (`backend-go/models/creator_history.go`):
  - Tracks historical snapshots of creator statistics
  - Records changes for media likes, post likes, and followers
  - Enables trend analysis and change visualization

#### 2. Database Migration
- Updated `backend-go/database/migrate.go` to include Creator and CreatorHistory models in auto-migration

#### 3. Fansly API Client Refactoring
- Consolidated multiple calls to `contentdiscovery/media/suggestionsnew` endpoint
- Created unified `GetSuggestionsData` method that returns posts, creators, and suggestions
- Added `FanslyAccount` type to represent creator data from API
- Removed duplicate code and improved API efficiency

#### 4. API Handler
- Created `CreatorHandler` (`backend-go/handlers/creator_handler.go`):
  - `GET /api/creators` endpoint with:
    - Pagination support (page, limit)
    - Search functionality (by username or display name)
    - Sorting options (followers, mediaLikes, postLikes, updatedAt, change)
    - History inclusion with date range filtering
    - Change calculation from historical data

#### 5. Routes
- Updated `backend-go/routes/routes.go` to register the creators endpoint

#### 6. Background Workers
- Extended `tag_discovery.go`:
  - Added `discoverCreators` function to discover new creators during tag discovery
  - Fetches creators from top 5 tags by view count
  - Efficiently reuses API calls already being made for tag discovery

- Extended `tag_updater.go`:
  - Added `updateCreators` function to update creator statistics
  - Updates creators on 24-hour cycle (same as tags)
  - Fetches up to 20 creators per run that need updating
  - Creates history entries with calculated changes
  - Handles deletion detection when creators disappear from API

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Creators Page
- Created `frontend/src/routes/creators/+page.ts` - Page load function with:
  - URL parameter handling for pagination, search, sorting
  - History date range support
  - Error handling and default values

- Created `frontend/src/routes/creators/+page.svelte` - Main creators page with:
  - Search functionality
  - Date range picker for history filtering
  - Sortable table columns
  - Expandable rows for history visualization
  - Change indicators with trend icons
  - Pagination controls
  - Responsive design

#### 2. Creator History Component
- Created `frontend/src/lib/components/CreatorHistory.svelte`:
  - Multi-series line chart for visualizing creator metrics over time
  - Toggle between viewing all metrics or individual metrics
  - Chart.js integration with proper date handling
  - Data table showing historical values and changes
  - Color-coded metrics (followers: blue, media likes: green, post likes: orange)

#### 3. Navigation
- Updated `frontend/src/lib/components/AppSidebar.svelte`:
  - Added Creators menu item with Users icon
  - Maintains active state highlighting

#### 4. Shared Utilities
- Updated `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` with:
  - `formatNumber()` - Consistent number formatting
  - `formatDate()` - Date formatting with Unix timestamp support
  - `calculateChange()` - Calculate change and percentage from history data

## Technical Decisions

1. **Reused Existing Patterns**: Followed the same architecture as Tags feature for consistency
2. **Extended Workers**: Rather than creating new workers, extended existing ones to minimize resource usage
3. **Unified API Calls**: Consolidated Fansly API calls to reduce duplication and improve efficiency
4. **24-Hour Update Cycle**: Matches the tag update frequency to maintain consistency
5. **Batch Processing**: Limited to 20 creators per update cycle to manage API rate limits

## Code Quality
- All Go code formatted with `go fmt`
- All Go code validated with `go vet`
- All TypeScript/Svelte code formatted with Prettier
- All TypeScript/Svelte code validated with ESLint and svelte-check
- No compilation or linting errors

## Recent Updates

### Creator Updater Worker Refactoring
- Created dedicated `creator_updater.go` file with `CreatorUpdaterWorker` struct
- Implemented `ProcessCreators` function that:
  - Creates new creators with initial history entry
  - Updates existing creators if last check was more than 24 hours ago
  - Handles both creation and updates in a single method
  - Uses database transactions for data consistency
  - Properly tracks changes between updates
- Removed creator-related code from `tag_updater.go` 
- Updated `tag_discovery.go` to use the new `CreatorUpdaterWorker`

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `tag_handler.go` to properly handle the new `TagResponseData` structure returned by `GetTagWithContext`

## Next Steps (if needed)
- Add creator request functionality (similar to tag requests)
- Implement creator search/discovery by username
- Add export functionality for creator data
- Consider adding more detailed analytics views
