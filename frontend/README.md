# FToolbox Frontend

SvelteKit frontend for FToolbox, deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run type checking
pnpm check

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```env
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For production, set this in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard.

## Building

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## Deployment to Cloudflare Pages

### First-time setup

1. Login to Cloudflare:

```bash
pnpm wrangler login
```

2. Create a new Pages project:

```bash
pnpm wrangler pages project create ftoolbox-frontend
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to production (uses env vars from Cloudflare dashboard)
pnpm pages:deploy

# Deploy to preview branch
pnpm pages:deploy:preview

# Deploy with custom API URL from command line
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api.com pnpm pages:deploy:with-api
```

### Environment Variables in Cloudflare Pages

**IMPORTANT**: Environment variables for SvelteKit must be set in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard during the build process.

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages project settings
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment variables
3. Add the following variables for **Production** (and optionally Preview):
   - `PUBLIC_API_URL` - Your backend API URL (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com`)

These variables are needed at BUILD TIME, not runtime. The wrangler.toml `[vars]` section does NOT work for SvelteKit environment variables.

### Local testing with Wrangler

```bash
# Test the production build locally with Cloudflare Pages environment
pnpm build
pnpm pages:dev
```
